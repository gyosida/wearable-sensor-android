# Wearable Sensor Android

Android wear application that communicates with the server through RealTime SDK to move a 3D cube in real time.

# Description

  Best practices used in order to enable the communication between the Android Wear and a mobile device.
  We use the new WearAPI allowing us to connect to one or more devices. Enabling the accelerometer in the 
  Android Wear and sending the data to the mobile device.
  The mobile device is in charge of the communication to the server through the RealTime SDK (more info @ http://realtime.co/)

# Things to find in this project:

 - Implementation of RealTime SDK. (http://realtime.co/)
 - Communication between Mobile and Wear application.
 - Implementation of Accelerometer in Android Wear.
